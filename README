PDFPrint
--------

This is a command-line, and GUI application for printing PDF files,
written in Lazarus/Freepascal. It allows you to easily include PDF
printing in your Windows applications and scripts.

It is potentially cross-platform, although has only been designed
for Windows so far.

Building
--------

PDFPrint will build with Lazarus 0.9.30, fpc 2.4.2 or later, and requires no 
additional components or libraries, except for winspool.pp, which is included. 
winspool.pp is taken from fpc 2.2.4.

Dependencies
------------

In order to use PDFPrint, you will need to obtain a copy of gsdll32.dll from the
GPL Ghostscript project and copy the file into the same directory.  If you require,
you can also add a cidfmap file to the program directory.


Usage
-----

Command-line interface:

pdfprint [options] filename

This will print a file to the default printer.

Optional command line options:

-from NN			First page to print.	

-to NN				Last page to print.

-resolution NN		Set the the DPI of the output (default 300).

-printer "name"	Name of the printer to use.

-dialog				Display printer setup dialog. 

-silent				Hide the GUI.

-force-ps			Force PostScript printing.

GUI Usage:

To use the GUI launch the application without any parameters. The GUI is very simplistic and 
contains a single button which uses a dialog to open a file, displays the printer setup dialog 
and then prints the file.
