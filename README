This will print a file to the default printer.

Optional command line options:

-from NN		First page to print.	

-to NN			Last page to print.

-resolution		Set the the DPI of the output.

-printer "name"  Name of the printer to use.

contains a single button which uses a dialog to open a file, displays the printer setup dialog 
and then prints the file.
